mdbook-curly
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arminha/mdbook-curly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arminha/mdbook-curly)

[mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) preprocessor that replaces straight quotes with curly quotes, except within code blocks or code spans.

It does the same as the **curly-quotes** option of the mdBook HTML renderer. The only advantage is that it can be applied to any renderer.
